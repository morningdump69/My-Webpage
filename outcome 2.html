    <p> The main programme i used was VSCode withint this programme I used html, which made it so i could put my writing in order aswell as put splits in paragraphs when needed.</p>

    <h1>2.3 strengths and weaknesses of you final project</h1>
   
    <p>My main weakness to my project is lack of time to completely develope it to my maximum potential that my website could be.</p>

    <p> I feel that with more time an experience I could have produced a website with more detail than I have already done.</p>

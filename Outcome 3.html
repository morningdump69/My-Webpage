          <h1>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency</h1>

          <p>I feel that Doing the project alone it was alot more efiicient due to the fact that it was all my code therefor it was easier to go back and forth between both my css and html to add things in singularly</p>

          <p>If i was making the website in a team the we would constantly have to be pushing the code after each fix/change to github, the problem with this is that with the code not being my own I would have to throught each line one by one and change my code to match up with their html code, working in a team is also an advantage due to you only have to focus on creating one set of code instead of multiple.</p>

          <h1>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h1>

          <p>I could improve productivity by trying to not make my piece of work perfect, I personally feel that I have it in my head that my project has to be perfect, also I should minimise talking to other people around me to improve my productivity.</p>

          <h1>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects </h1>

          <p>I feel that next time <I></I> would like to try and create a website in a team to experience multiple ways of creating a website, also this experience would also help me to see how other people like to lay things out to how i like to lay them out, some people may prefere to use javascript in their html for a more smoother professional interface</p>

          <h1>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions </h1>

          <p>I would test my digital soloutions bty actually doing them in my next piece of work.</p>

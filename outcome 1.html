    <h1>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h1>


    <p>A huge purpose of IT in the generic world is customer communication, a lot of businesses that are approached with projects receive a project brief through an email, where the customer can send the business a document which has each and every expectation as well as all images and detail they need to design stuff. It’s important that IT is used for customer communication for quick and efficient communication this means the client will get a final finished product much quicker.

        <p>
                    Technology can be used for high level security, a lot of opposing businesses will want to try and gain an advantage in anyway possible, but with recent technology companies can encrypt files to make them harder to get into securing a product safely.</p>

                <p>
                    Research is a huge part of our products these days, research allows us to look at competitors items and take the best parts of their products and put them into one hopefully getting a good final product, also a lot of other things online can be good sources for finalizing products.

    <h1>1.2 - Methods,skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully.</h1>


    <p>The main skill for a good successful project is good teamwork and communication, multiple companies have many processes to go through different processes will be assigned to different teams depending on their professional areas. Before work can be completed you need to communicate with different areas of team to get an overall idea of what is needed and expected of your team.<p>

            <p>A good method/system a lot of success companies use is the kanban method, this consists of a sort of time board of everything that needs to be complete and different areas will be taken on by different teams in the company once the task is completed that process will be added to the end, once the final project is completed then all tasks should be put on the right hand side of the system.</div>

    <h1>1.4 - risks with digital projects</h1>


    <p>Alot of key risks with failed digital projects are that anyone at any point could possibly access my personal processes on what i'm going to do and how I'm going to do and they could steal it.</p>

            <p>Alot of common digital project fail due to lack of funding or even over funding on specific projects, also lack of teamwork within a company can cause companies to collapse and lose team members to competitors companies where they can take your ideas to them and present them as their own which will then help your competitors to complete maybe a more advanced final project.</p>

    <h1>1.5 - Selecting IT systems and software</h1>


    <p>Selecting the right IT software may change depending on what company you work for some companies may use a specific code site. Selecting the correct software will mean you need to start looking through for relevant software and then narrowing them down to a single one which works best for the job at hand. You also need to know the objective at the start of the project whether is to appeal to the like of business people or the youth.</p>

    <h1>1.6 - describe on how your chosen technologies have helped you</h1>

    <p>Trello has helped me design my project as I can align everything I want and slowly drag them along until my final project is completed, once I have my trello board with all ojectives/tasks on the right side of the screen then I will know that my website is finished.</p>

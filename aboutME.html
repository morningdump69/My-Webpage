        <p>Im Ross, I'm 19 years old and I was born 19/03/2000 (19th March 2000)
            In my spare time I'm an avid gamer, I've always been a huge gamer since a young age.
            The first game console I ever played was the playstation one but then I gradually moved onto other consoles as I grew older 
            the next console I owned was the Nintendo64 which I would play countless hours of mario kart outside of my school time
            I later went on to owning an xbox and I stuck with xbox since that day even though I now pc game.
        Aswell as a gamer i'm also a huge animal lover,            I've had multiple cats and dogs in the past aswell as hamsters and degus. i currently own a Staffordshire Bull Terrier called Duke</p>

    <div id=rotate><img src="Duke2.jpg"  height="400" width="200"></div> 


        </p > When I'm not gaming I'm usually listening to music, my prefered genre of music is towards the metal area but i also listen to other genre,
        a few of my current favourite bands are: 
        <ul> 
            <li>Slipknot;</li>
            <li>Beartooth;</li>
            <li>Lamb Of God;</li>
            <li>Guns And Roses.</li>
        </ul> 
        I have completed 2 years of college during those years i completed my level 2 and 3 in mechanical engineering,
        further on I have also completed a level 2 in warehousing and employment and I am currently completing a develop course with Codenation.
        After completeing college I wanted to work with airbus but I missed the apply deadline and ended up going into warehousing.
